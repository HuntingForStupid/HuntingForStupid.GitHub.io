If there is an admin account active for a lab, the credentials are admin:admin123

1. I launched Caido.

2. I checked to see if there was an admin login using the set/known creds, but there was not.

3. Once logged in, the app appeared to be an online platform to test your typing speed. I tried to do everything I could with the app, in order to generate some traffic to view via the proxy.  I took a couple typing tests, viewed the Dashboard, checked my stats, etc.
